# IDE Features Integration Test Plan

## Smart Documentation Generator Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Basic Documentation Generation**
   - Open a JavaScript/TypeScript file with functions
   - Click the "Docs" button in the file tabs
   - Click "Generate Documentation"
   - Verify documentation is generated with sections: Overview, Parameters, Returns, Examples, Usage, Notes

2. **Documentation Caching**
   - Generate documentation for a file
   - Close and reopen the documentation panel
   - Verify cached documentation is loaded instantly

3. **Documentation Export**
   - Generate documentation
   - Click "Download" button
   - Verify markdown file is downloaded with proper formatting

4. **Multi-file Documentation**
   - Generate documentation for multiple files
   - Switch between files
   - Verify each file maintains its own documentation

### Expected Behavior
- Documentation panel appears on the right side when toggled
- AI generates comprehensive documentation based on code analysis
- Documentation includes practical examples and best practices
- Caching reduces API calls for repeated requests

## Context-Aware Code Completion++ Testing

### Test Cases

1. **AI-Enhanced Completions**
   - Enable AI completions using the "AI" toggle in file tabs
   - Type partial code (e.g., `console.l`)
   - Verify AI-powered suggestions appear with detailed descriptions

2. **Project Context Awareness**
   - Create multiple related files (e.g., component and its types)
   - In one file, start typing a reference to another file
   - Verify cross-file suggestions appear

3. **Import Suggestions**
   - Start typing an import statement: `import { } from './`
   - Verify local file suggestions appear
   - Try common package names and verify npm package suggestions

4. **Method Signatures**
   - Type a method call like `fetch(`
   - Verify signature help appears with parameter information
   - Test with other common methods like `addEventListener`, `setTimeout`

5. **Framework-Specific Completions**
   - In a React file, type `use` and verify React hooks suggestions
   - In a CSS file, verify CSS property completions
   - Test HTML tag completions in HTML files

### Expected Behavior
- AI completions are contextually relevant to current code
- Suggestions include imports from project files
- Method signatures show parameter information
- Framework-specific completions based on file type and content

## Integration Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Documentation + AI Completions**
   - Enable both features simultaneously
   - Generate documentation while using AI completions
   - Verify both features work without conflicts

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large files (>1000 lines)
   - Verify completion response time is acceptable (<500ms)
   - Check memory usage doesn't spike excessively

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test with invalid API keys
   - Test with network disconnection
   - Verify graceful fallback to basic completions

4. **Theme Compatibility**
   - Test with both light and dark themes
   - Verify documentation panel styling
   - Check AI completion popup styling

### Expected Behavior
- Features work independently and together
- Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- Consistent UI/UX across themes
- Acceptable performance with large codebases

## Manual Testing Steps

### Setup
1. Ensure AI API key is configured in settings
2. Create a test project with multiple files
3. Include different file types (JS, TS, HTML, CSS)

### Documentation Generator Test
1. Open `components/code-editor.tsx`
2. Click "Docs" button in file tabs
3. Click "Generate Documentation"
4. Wait for AI to generate documentation
5. Verify all sections are populated
6. Test download functionality
7. Test regenerate functionality

### AI Completions Test
1. Ensure "AI" toggle is enabled in file tabs
2. Create a new JavaScript file
3. Type: `const user = { name: 'John', age: 30 };`
4. On new line, type: `user.` and wait for completions
5. Verify property suggestions appear
6. Type: `console.` and verify method suggestions
7. Test import completions by typing: `import React from '`

### Cross-File References Test
1. Create `utils.js` with: `export const helper = () => 'test';`
2. In another file, type: `import { h` 
3. Verify `helper` suggestion appears
4. Test hover over imported functions

## Success Criteria

### Documentation Generator

- ✅ Supports multiple file types

### AI Completions
- ✅ Provides context-aware code suggestions
- ✅ Includes cross-file references
- ✅ Shows method signatures and parameter hints
- ✅ Supports import suggestions
- ✅ Framework-specific completions
- ✅ Graceful fallback when AI unavailable

### Integration
- ✅ Both features work simultaneously
- ✅ Consistent performance
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Theme compatibility
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness (if applicable)

## Known Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Heavy usage may hit API rate limits
2. **Context Size**: Large files may exceed AI context limits
3. **Language Support**: Best results with JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Network Dependency**: Requires internet connection for AI features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Mode**: Cache common completions for offline use
2. **Custom Templates**: Allow users to customize documentation templates
3. **Team Sharing**: Share documentation across team members
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Track completion usage and accuracy
5. **Multi-language Support**: Expand beyond JavaScript ecosystem
