# 🛡️ Bug Prevention & Focus Field System

Welcome to the future of code safety and developer productivity! This system introduces two revolutionary features that will transform how you write and maintain code.

## 🚀 Features Overview

### 1. Null-Safety Guardian 🛡️
**The world's most intelligent null-safety refactorer** that prevents the most common JavaScript runtime error before it even happens.

### 2. Focus Field System 🎯
**Cognitive load-reducing code focus** that creates a "noise-canceling" experience for your code, letting you focus purely on what matters.

## 🛡️ Null-Safety Guardian

### What It Does
Automatically detects and fixes potential runtime errors caused by accessing properties on `null` or `undefined` objects.

### How It Works
1. **Real-time Analysis**: Continuously scans your code for dangerous patterns
2. **Smart Detection**: Identifies property chains, method calls, and array access without null checks
3. **One-Click Fixes**: Instantly applies optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent errors
4. **Preview Changes**: See exactly what will change before applying fixes

### Detected Issues
- **Property Chains**: `response.data.user.name` → `response?.data?.user?.name`
- **Method Calls**: `user.profile.getName()` → `user?.profile?.getName()`
- **Array Access**: `users[0].name` → `users?.[0]?.name`

### Example
```javascript
// Before (Dangerous)
function getUserName(response) {
  return response.data.user.name; // Could crash!
}

// After (Safe)
function getUserName(response) {
  return response?.data?.user?.name; // Safe!
}
```

## 🎯 Focus Field System

### What It Does
Creates an intelligent "focus field" around selected code elements, dimming everything else to reduce cognitive load.

### How It Works
1. **Click to Focus**: Click on any variable, function, or class
2. **Automatic Discovery**: System finds all related definitions, usages, and modifications
3. **Visual Focus**: Related lines stay bright, unrelated code fades into background
4. **Smart Navigation**: Easy navigation between related code elements

### Visual Effects
- **Related Lines**: Bright blue highlighting with left border
- **Focus Range**: Subtle green highlighting for context
- **Unrelated Lines**: Configurable dimming (20% to 80%)
- **Target Highlight**: Orange glow around selected element

### Example
```typescript
class UserService {
  private users: User[] = [];
  
  getUserById(id: string): User | undefined {
    return this.users.find(user => user.id === id); // ← Click here
  }
  
  updateUser(id: string, updates: Partial<User>): boolean {
    const user = this.users.find(user => user.id === id); // ← Related usage
    if (userIndex === -1) return false;
    
    this.users[userIndex] = { ...this.users[userIndex], ...updates }; // ← Related modification
    return true;
  }
}
```

When you click on `getUserById`, the system will:
- Highlight the method definition
- Highlight all usages of `getUserById`
- Highlight related user operations
- Dim unrelated code for focus
